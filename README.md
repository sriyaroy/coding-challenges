# ML Engineering Interview Challenges 🚀💻

Welcome to the **ML Engineering Challenges** repository! 🎉 This repo will have **50 challenges** ranging from **Easy** to **Hard** that are designed to help you sharpen ML engineering skills. 

#### (Many of these challenges have been designed with a Computer Vision engineer in mind as I've found it hard to find targeted resources, however, many of the challenges are transferrable!)

## What's Inside? 📂

- **Levels of Difficulty**:
  - **Easy**🏃‍♂️
  - **Medium**💡
  - **Hard**🚀
- **Contents**: (filling as I write the solutions):
  - 🚀Batch Normalisation from Scratch: [Problem](https://github.com/sriyaroy/coding-challenges/blob/main/problems/batch-norm.py) [Solution](https://github.com/sriyaroy/coding-challenges/blob/main/solutions/batch-norm.py)
  - 🏃‍♂️Simple Image Data Augmentation Pipeline: [Problem](https://github.com/sriyaroy/coding-challenges/blob/main/problems/image-aug-pipeline.py) [Solution](https://github.com/sriyaroy/coding-challenges/blob/main/solutions/image-aug-pipeline.py)
  - 💡Optimise Image Processing with Vectorisation: [Problem](https://github.com/sriyaroy/coding-challenges/blob/main/problems/numpy-vectorisation.py) [Solution](https://github.com/sriyaroy/coding-challenges/blob/main/solutions/numpy-vectorisation.py)
  - 💡PyTorch Training Loop from Scratch: [Problem](https://github.com/sriyaroy/coding-challenges/blob/main/problems/training-loop.py) [Solution](https://github.com/sriyaroy/coding-challenges/blob/main/solutions/training-loop.py)
  - 💡2D Convolution from Scratch using Numpy
    - No padding, dilation or stride: [Problem](https://github.com/sriyaroy/coding-challenges/blob/main/problems/2D-convolution-only.py) [Solution](https://github.com/sriyaroy/coding-challenges/blob/main/solutions/2D-convolution-only.py)
    - [Only padding]
    - [Padding, stride & dilation]
- **Hands-On Python Code**: Each challenge comes with scaffold code to get started. This can be found in the 'Problems' folder and solutions in the 'Solutions' folder 🐍
- **Solutions**: Every solution is my own and if you have a better approach, please share 👩🏽‍💻

## Love or Hate? 🤔
