# ML Engineering Interview Challenges 🚀💻

Welcome to the **ML Engineering Challenges** repository! 🎉 This repo will have **50 challenges** ranging from **Easy** to **Hard** that are designed to help you sharpen ML engineering skills. 

#### (Many of these challenges have been designed with a Computer Vision engineer in mind as I've found it hard to find targeted resources, however, many of the challenges are transferrable!)

## What's Inside? 📂

- **Levels of Difficulty**:
  - **Easy**🏃‍♂️
  - **Medium**💡
  - **Hard**🚀
- **Contents**: (filling as I write the solutions):
  - 🚀[Batch Normalisation from Scratch](https://github.com/sriyaroy/coding-challenges/blob/main/problems/batch-norm.py)
  - 🏃‍♂️[Simple Image Data Augmentation Pipeline](https://github.com/sriyaroy/coding-challenges/blob/main/problems/image-aug-pipeline.py)
  - 💡[Optimise Image Processing with Vectorisation](https://github.com/sriyaroy/coding-challenges/blob/main/problems/numpy-vectorisation.py)
  - 💡[PyTorch Training Loop from Scratch](https://github.com/sriyaroy/coding-challenges/blob/main/problems/training-loop.py)
- **Hands-On Python Code**: Each challenge comes with scaffold code to get started. This can be found in the 'Problems' folder and solutions in the 'Solutions' folder 🐍
- **Solutions**: Every solution is my own and if you have a better approach, please share 👩🏽‍💻
